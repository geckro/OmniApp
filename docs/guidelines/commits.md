# Commit and pull request guidelines

Where possible, use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). I would recommend using the following types:
- `fix`: bug fixes
- `feat`: add or remove a feature
- `docs`: documentation additions, modifications and removal
- `refactor`: rewritten and restructured code, does not actually change anything. If it changes something, use feat/fix
- `test`: testing cases, i.e. unit tests
- `style`: stuff that just improves the formatting of the code
- `perf`: specially designed for improving the performance of the app
- `build`: use this if you modify builds, ci, etc.
- `chore`: just general cleanup work, like modifying an unimportant line or updating dependencies

Make sure the commit description tells what the commit does.
